	The Memento design pattern uses three main classes: Memento, Originator, and Caretaker. The Memento class keeps track of the state of an object that can be restored, the Originator class creates states for the Mementos, and the Caretaker class uses the Memento to restore an object’s state. This design pattern is useful because it allows you to capture the current state of an object in case you need to revert back to that state at a later time. It essentially works like an “undo” button, without violating encapsulation.
